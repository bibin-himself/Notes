CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) 
Is a security feature that prevents unauthorized requests between different domains.
 By default, browsers block cross-origin AJAX requests unless explicitly allowed.

>  When Do You Need CORS?
*Your frontend (React, Vue, Angular) is running on http://localhost:3000,
 but the backend (Node.js/Express) is on http://localhost:5000.
*Your API needs to be accessed from a different domain.
*You're calling an API from JavaScript that is hosted on another domain.

*npm install cors


*  Use CORS in Express
    Modify your server.js or app.js:

const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");

const app = express();

// Enable CORS for all routes
app.use(cors());

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("CORS is enabled!");
});

app.listen(5000, () => console.log("Server running on port 5000"));
